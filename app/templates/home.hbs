<h4>Biography</h4>
<p>
  I am currently studying economics and computer programming at the University of Southern California.
  I have always had a passion for breaking things open to see how they work and how they can be improved,
  whether that was my mom's vacuum or my car. Through my coursework and research projects,
  I have become addicted to gathering data and using it to see exactly why countries or businesses are run
  the way they are, and am hoping to continue pursuing this passion.
